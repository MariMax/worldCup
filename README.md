# World Cup Challenge

[ ![Codeship Status for MariMax/worldCup](https://codeship.com/projects/b9ad3820-da4e-0132-b82d-5acc9fe35d9d/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/79280)




The task

We liked the last world cup very much and so we would like to have a closer look at the results.
The task is designed to assess your interest and experience in front-end web development. We want to see your code, your approach, and your talent.

###Minimum requirements

Use AngularJS and an API.

For each of the eight groups there should be:

1. a table showing the final result
2. a pie chart dividing the points of each team
We leave the design and user experience completely up to you. Of course we are happy to see more statistics - so if you have ideas feel free to suprise us.

###What we are looking for

* Does the app meet the minimum requirements?
* Is your code clean and well written? What was your approach?
* How does your app look and feel?
###Getting started

Just go ahead and create your HTML, CSS and JS files.
You are free to use any public library out there.

For the API there is http://worldcup.sfg.io for example.

###When you are done

Zip your code, make sure that your code works unzipped and send it to us.
