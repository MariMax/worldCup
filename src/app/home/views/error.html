  <div class="error-view">
    Something went wrong <br />
    I guess some backend problems <br />
    But You can always run app without backend locally <br />
    Just run site locally with command <span>gulp serve --dev 1</span>
    it will use mockups<br />
    Error itself: <br />
    {{error | json}}
  </div>
